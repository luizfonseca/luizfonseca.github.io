Ha! I'm returning all the things I loved to their proper place. Once upon a time, I wrote a book (probably it's in a box right now), a lot of short stories ([you can see one here](http://www.gargantadaserpente.com/coral/contos/lcf_setemeia.shtml)) and guess what? I used to be a [sketch artist](http://www.flogao.com.br/eudesenho/47717778). Of course I'm not going to restore all of my past hobbies, but I'll try to find all the things I love - or loved - and I'll make them happen again. They are part of me. Take a sit and enjoy the ride. ;)
